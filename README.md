# UK-Road-Safety2023-Analysis-Forecasting

**Data-driven analysis and predictive modelling of UK road accidents using Apriori association rules, clustering, and time series forecasting (ARIMA/ARMA).**  
The project identifies risk patterns, accident hotspots, and regional trends to support evidence-based road safety strategies.

## üîç Project Overview

This project explores road traffic accident data across the UK using advanced data mining and statistical modelling techniques. The dataset includes over 1.9 million records across four relational tables (accident, casualty, vehicle, and LSOA). The primary objectives include:

- **Identifying high-risk patterns** using the Apriori algorithm
- **Geospatial clustering** to detect regional accident hotspots
- **Time series forecasting** (ARIMA/ARMA) for predicting weekly and daily accident trends
- **Data cleaning & preprocessing** of complex, incomplete, and encoded records

## üìà Key Highlights

- Achieved **RMSE of 47.77** on regional forecasts and **0.0 RMSE** on select local forecasts
- Discovered high-frequency accident conditions under **favorable weather, lighting, and road surface**, indicating potential human error as a major factor
- Identified and visualized **high-incident hotspots** in Kingston upon Hull using clustering techniques
- Proposed **policy and safety recommendations** based on accident timing, pedestrian trends, and local geography

## üéØ Impact

This project supports **data-driven decision-making** in urban planning, traffic enforcement, and road infrastructure improvements. Insights generated from association mining and forecasting models can guide government agencies in deploying timely and targeted interventions.
